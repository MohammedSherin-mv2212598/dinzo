# Dinzo (Pre-Development)

**Concept: A personal food discovery assistant that organizes Instagram food recommendations**

## Project Vision

Dinzo aims to solve a common problem for food enthusiasts: keeping track of all the food spots you discover on Instagram. Our planned application will allow users to forward food reels from Instagram to our account, automatically extracting and organizing key information about each restaurant.

## The Problem We're Solving

- Food enthusiasts frequently save food-related reels on Instagram
- These saved recommendations often get forgotten or lost
- There's no easy way to organize and retrieve this information later
- Users want a centralized place to track places they want to visit

## Proposed Solution

Dinzo will:
1. Accept shared food reels from Instagram
2. Extract key information automatically, including:
   - Restaurant name
   - Featured food items
   - Price information
   - Location details
3. Create digital "cards" with this information
4. Allow users to organize, search, and filter their saved restaurants

## Development Status

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Dinzo is currently in the conceptual phase. This README outlines our vision and development plans. The application is not yet functional or available for download.

## Technical Approach (Preliminary)

We're exploring:
- Natural language processing to extract restaurant details from captions and audio
- Options for Instagram API integration (or alternatives if needed)
- Mobile app development frameworks (React Native vs. Flutter)

## Initial Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Planning
